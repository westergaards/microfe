## Microfrontend POC

There is quite a bit of work to do here, I hope to accomplish the following

[ ] - Have a development environment that is self contained.  
[ ] - Have a development environment that is composed of repos.  
[ ] - Have a deployment process completely automated.
[ ] - Tie in authentication (Okta).  
[ ] - Tie in authorization and backend.  
[ ] - Introduce a state solution that will be used at the shell level.  
[ ] - Provide a common interface for interacting with the app.  
[ ] - Provide a way to style from a single place.  
[ ] - Configure sourcemaps.  
[ ] - Add danger/eslint/prettier/tsconfig/commitizen.  
[ ] - Create Yarn workspace.  
[ ] - Dynamically load menus.  
[ ] - Setup @alias
[ ] - Localization settings
[ ] - Accessibility
[ ] - GraphQl
